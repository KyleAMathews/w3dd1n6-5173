        <h3>May, 2009</h3>
        <p>Kyle and Shannon go on double date with‚Ä¶ each other's roommates!</p>
        <p>
          Shannon says she wants to edit a science journal. Kyle thinks: ‚Äúwhat
          an attractive woman!‚Äù
        </p>

            Shannon hears that Kyle planted a garden behind his neighbor‚Äôs house
            and asks to go see it. The garden is more impressive than she
            expected.
          </em>
        </p>
        <h3>August 2009</h3>
        <p>
          Kyle texts Shannon to ask her on a date and she doesn't respond for
          several weeks because her phone is broken üòÖ
        </p>
        <p>They plan to go on another date, and then this happens:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Shannon:</strong>
          {` `}
          ‚ÄúKyle, I have to reschedule our date. I‚Äôm in the hospital with
          appendicitis and go into surgery in 45 minutes.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Kyle:</strong> ‚ÄúThat is the best excuse I‚Äôve ever heard for
          rescheduling a date! Good luck!‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          They finally go on date a few days after Shannon has her appendix out.
          Shannon was probably on pain killers. Neither of them remember the
          events of the date.
        </p>
        <h3>October 2009</h3>
        <p>Shannon exits to southern California for a 1.5 year LDS mission.</p>

        <p>Kyle exits to northern California to chase startup dreams.</p>
        <h3>May 2015</h3>
        <p>Shannon messages Kyle on Spotify</p>
        <p>
          It‚Äôs been 6 years since we last talked and then Shannon follows Kyle
          on Spotify and thinks this song he's listening to is cool.

        <p>
          Through Facebook, she realizes that Kyle lives in San Francisco and
          since she‚Äôs already planning on road tripping through California with
          a friend, she messages him on Facebook to see if he wants to hang out.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Shannon:</strong> Hey me and a friend are going to be in Palo
          Alto/San Fran over 4th of July weekend! It'd be cool to meet up
          sometime! And any suggestions for cool 4th o' July things...?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Kyle:</strong>
          {` `}
          Would love to hang out plus will brainstorm some ideas ‚Ä¶ [later] sooo
          I had an idea for something to do while you and your friend are here.
          A friend and I were talking about this who also has some friends
          coming into town. Basically Saturday the fourth we'd do a "bakery
          crawl" starting at my house in inner sunset and visiting first a
          bakery near me and then city hiking our way to a bakery in the
          mission. It's a pretty walk and you'd get to eat lots of delicious
          bread.

        <p>Story from two perspectives:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Shannon:</strong> My brother and I went to see Kyle after he
          gave a talk at a UtahJS meetup and got ice cream at Rockwell‚Äôs ice
          cream parlor on University Avenue in Provo. My primary motivation for
          going to talk to Kyle was actually to convince my brother to move to
          San Francisco, because my brother is a UX designer and I was thinking
          he might love hearing about Kyle‚Äôs life out there. They had fun
          talking and so did I--and then, after giving Kyle a ride home to stay
          at his mom‚Äôs house in Lehi, Kyle and I talked in the car for a long
          time and it was really fun. When I got home, I wrote something in my
          iPhone notes about how ‚Äúit almost felt like we were going to kiss‚Äù
          when we were talking in the car. I still sort of dismissed the
          experience since Kyle lived far away, though I did keep texting him
          every once in a while.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Kyle:</strong> I was excited by her interest in attending the
          meetup. I still wasn‚Äôt sure what I thought about her. In our
          conversation on the way home, I was really surprised by the strong
          connection I felt and how interested I was in everything she was
          saying. I really appreciated the depth of how she thought and felt
          things in her life.

          under guise of asking Shannon's help with his startup.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Shannon:</strong> I remember thinking ‚Äúhm, we‚Äôve been talking
          for an hour and still no talk about business‚Ä¶‚Äù ;)

          <strong>Thai food and hike date</strong> ‚Äî They plan a ‚Äúget together‚Äù
          when Kyle is in Utah ‚Äî Shannon asks if it‚Äôs a date ‚Äî Kyle says yes,
          proposes that they stay in touch through email afterwards, which
          fizzles into a friendship again because Shannon didn‚Äôt want to do
          another long distance relationship (she had attempted it several times
          with mixed results :).

          {` `}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-beam">‚Äúi-beam‚Äù</a>. They go
          to a Mexican dessert place. Cashier tells Shannon in Spanish that we
          ‚Äúlook so in love‚Äù (‚Äúles parecen tan enamorados!‚Äù). Shannon tells Kyle
          this and he has absolutely no idea how to respond so says nothing :)

        <p>
          <strong>Dinner and bike ride date:</strong> ‚Äî Kyle and Shannon got
          dinner and then a few days later, go on a bike ride with Shannon‚Äôs
          friends, Mallory and Aaron. Shannon asks Kyle if he likes her and they
          talk for a long time and she sends this text afterwards: ‚ÄúThat hug was
          really nice :)‚Äù Then on Sunday they make dinner, go on a walk and look
          at gardens, and watch a couple episodes of Jonathan Strange and Mr.
          Norrell and KISSSSS for the first time. Shannon is in the midst of
          trying to date 3 different guys, ends up halfway dating another man
          for fall 2017.
